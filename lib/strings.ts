// User-facing wording, kept apart from the rules that use it.
//
// The point of this file is a single place to rewrite the words in Liam's voice
// at the end, without touching logic. Everything here is text a guest or a
// provider reads; nothing here decides behaviour. A key is stable and internal;
// only its `label` and `hint` are the copy.
//
// THE PRINCIPLE FOR A SUB-TYPE LABEL: name what the GUEST is buying, not the
// provider's job title. "Dining & private chef" over "Private chef & catering";
// "Food to order" over "Cakes & baking". Keep this when the other categories'
// wording moves here too.
//
// Started with the Food & drink sub-types (Sep 2026). The other guest
// categories still carry their wording inline in lib/serviceProviders.ts and can
// move here the same way when they are reworded.

// The Food & drink sub-types. Keyed by the category key in GUEST_CATEGORIES.
//   - chef        a chef comes to the cottage (comes-to-you)
//   - food_order  made and collected or dropped off — the old Cakes & baking and
//                 Hampers & local produce merged, since they were the same shape,
//                 the same skipped screens and the same declarations; which one
//                 it is gets asked further down, not forked here (made-to-order)
//   - tastings    a booked tasting session (slot)
//   - cooking     a booked cooking class (slot)
